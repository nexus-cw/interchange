# interchange

Shared E2E-encrypted relay for Nexus Frame-to-Frame communication.

The Interchange is a small Go server that relays signed, end-to-end encrypted envelopes between paired Nexus instances. It cannot read message content; it only routes ciphertext between the two ends of a pair, gates pair establishment behind operator approval, and evicts old envelopes after a retention window.

Wire protocol: [`docs/spec.md`](./docs/spec.md).

Client library (Go): [`nexus-cw/casket-go`](https://github.com/nexus-cw/casket-go).

## What a Nexus needs to connect

1. A casket `Channel` for its own identity (Ed25519 signing key + ECDH key for body encryption).
2. A paired `Channel` per peer, established via the staged-approval pair flow (operator-gated on the receiving side).
3. HTTP access to an Interchange deployment. All interaction is six endpoints:

   - `GET  /.well-known/nexus-interchange` — discovery doc (capabilities, algorithms, endpoints)
   - `POST /pair/request` — submit a signed half, blocks until owner decides
   - `GET  /pair/requests/:id` — poll request state (pending / approved / denied)
   - `POST /pair/requests/:id/approve` *and* `POST /pair/requests/:id/deny` — owner-side actions, **tailnet-only listener**
   - `PUT  /mailbox/:pathId` — send an envelope
   - `GET  /mailbox/:pathId?since=<msg_id>` — receive
   - `POST /mailbox/:pathId/ack` — acknowledge receipt

See [`docs/spec.md`](./docs/spec.md) for envelope format, signing, content handling rules, and the full pairing workflow.

## Topology opacity

A Nexus implementing the client side knows *how* to call the endpoints. It does not know *what* is behind them — a single binary on a tailnet host, a load-balanced fleet, a self-hosted relay run by a third party. The wire protocol is the contract; deployment is opaque.

## Build and run

Requires Go 1.25+.

```sh
go build ./cmd/interchange
./interchange
```

Two listeners come up by default:

- **`:8443`** — public-facing (mailbox PUT/GET/ack, pair request/poll, discovery). Bind behind TLS / a Tailscale Funnel for production.
- **`:8444`** — tailnet-only (pair approve/deny). Bind to your tailnet interface (e.g. `tailscale0`) so only operators on the tailnet can approve pair requests.

Configure listener addresses, storage path, and retention via env vars or flags — see `cmd/interchange/main.go`.

## Storage

SQLite (pure-Go via `modernc.org/sqlite`, no CGO). Schema is embedded in `internal/storage/sqlite.go` and applied on startup with `IF NOT EXISTS` — no separate migration step. Three tables: `envelopes`, `pair_requests`, `pairs`.

## Test

```sh
go test ./...
```

91 tests across the discovery, storage, mailbox, sweep, crypto, and pairflow packages. Tests use `httptest` against in-process handlers — no network, no external dependencies.

## Status

Phase 2 of the relay build is complete (discovery, storage, mailbox handlers, retention sweep, Ed25519 verification, full pair flow with tailnet binding). Deployment to dMon and live cross-host handshake testing are the remaining items.
